# Logger
This class manages the logs of the systems. The Logs can be prediction results or error messages. Logger can store logs to a file or print them to the terminal. You can set the type of logging (printing on terminal or storing in file) in `configuration.yml`. If you do not specify any, it will print on terminal and store it in the log file.
