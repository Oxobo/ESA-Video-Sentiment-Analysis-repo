## Requirement/dependency
```python3```\
 ```Opencv``` 
## how to run 
1. Open the ```face_extractor.py```
2. Modify the path directory to the input folder, output folder and image extension type
3. Run the the face_extractor scripts as follows:
    ```bash
    python3 face_extractor.py
    ```

 of face in a variable, you need to call the ```face_extractor``` function as follows:
 
   ```bash
       your_varibale = your_class_obj.face_extractor(False)
   ```
